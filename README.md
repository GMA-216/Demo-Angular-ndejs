# Demo-Angular-nodejs
This a simple projects (users dashboard - CRUD); back-end API base on Nodejs and Front-end application made with Angular2.

You can start the project by following the following steps:

1) Download the 2 projects
2) Assume that your laptop has Nodejs version 6 or above, if not then just download the Nodejs setup for the official website: https://nodejs.org
2) Open the Terminal/command line inside each one of the folders and run the command npm install to get the necessary dependencies, maybe you need admin permissions if you're using a Mac: sudo npm install

Node: if you got an error while running npm install, then please delete the package-lock.json if booth folders (if it exist)

3) Here are 2 ways to run the project:
run the cmd npm run dev inside the /nodejs_api folder. (starting the server app and client app concurrently)
run the cmd npm start inside the /nodejs_api folder, then inside the /AdminPortal. (starting the server app and client app separately  
Yeep! Well now your server-side app is running under the http://localhost:8081 and client-side app under http://localhost:4200  (to login use mohamed as a username/password)     

Info: the current data are coming/saving from an https://mlab.com (cloud MongoDB service) instead of installing MongoDB locally.

I hope you got the app running easily.
